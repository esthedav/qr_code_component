## My process

It is a basic component, so I create a card and inside the card I create two containers, one for the image and other for the texts

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

Even if the component was easy, it took some time due to my amateurish. Also I noticed that the text was not the same as the one indicated in the instructions, so I changed it a little to match with the design
